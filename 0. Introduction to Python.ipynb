    "# What is Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "[Python](www.python.org) is a modern, general-purpose, object-oriented, high-level programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "General characteristics of Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *clean and simple language*: easy to read code, easy to learn syntax, maintainability scales well with size of projects.\n",
    "* *expressive language*: fewer lines of code, fewer bugs, easier to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Technical details:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *dynamically typed*: no need to define the type of variables, function arguments or return types.\n",
    "* *automatic memory management*: no need to explicitly allocate and deallocate memory for variables and data arrays.\n",
    "* *interpreted*: no need to compile the code, the Python interpreter reads and executes the python code directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ease of programming, minimizing the time required to develop, debug and maintain the code.\n",
    "* Well designed language that encourage many good programming practices:\n",
    "  * Modular and object-oriented programming, good system for packaging and re-use of code.\n",
    "  * Documentation tightly integrated with the code.\n",
    "* A large standard library, and a large collection of add-on packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Since Python is an interpreted and dynamically typed programming language, the execution of python code can be slow compared to compiled statically typed programming languages, such as C/C++.\n",
    "* Somewhat decentralized, with different environment, packages and documentation spread out at different places.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is not only a programming language, but often also refers to the standard implementation of the interpreter (technically referred to as [CPython](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPython)) that actually runs the Python code on a computer."

    "# Interpretation versus compilation\n",
    "\n",
    "The are two different types of computer languages: **compiled** languages and **interpreted** languages. Roughly speaking, programs written with *compiled languages* are first translated (**compiled**) into a form (**binary code**) that the computer hardware understands, and then run. Porgrams written with an **interpreted language** are translated step bt step by a special computer program, called **interpreter**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The *interpreter* is a computer program that directly executes instructions written in a interpreted language, without requiring them previously to have been compiled into a binary code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typical compliled languages are C++ and Go. Python is an interpreted language, like Perl and Javascript.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create and execute a compiled program, a programmer must:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create the program source code.\n",
    "* Parse or analyses all of the language statements in the source code for correctness. If incorrect, throws an error.\n",
    "* Convert source code to machine code.\n",
    "* Link different code files into a runnable program.\n",
    "* Run the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create and execute an interpreted program, a programmer must:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create the program source code.\n",
    "* Run the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "The is no linking of files or machine code generation. Source statements are analysed and executed line by line **during** execution.\n",

    "# Python environments\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different *environments* through which the Python *interpreter* can be used. Each environment has different advantages and is suitable for different workflows. One strength of Python is that it is versatile and can be used in complementary ways, but it can be confusing for beginners so we will start with a brief survey of python environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python interpreter\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard way to use the Python programming language is to use the Python interpreter to run Python code. The Python interpreter is a program that reads and execute the python code in files passed to it as arguments. At the command prompt, the command `python` is used to invoke the Python interpreter.\n",
    "For example, to run a file `my-program.py` that contains Python code from the command prompt, use:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "$ python my-program.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> The **$** symbol in the command line instructions denotes the prompt, so it must not be copy-pasted.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also start the interpreter by simply typing `python` at the command line, and interactively type Python code into the interpreter (press `Ctrl+D` or type `exit()` to exit):\n",
    "\n",
    "![python-shell.jpg](images/python-shell.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The `>>>` symbols represent the *prompt* where you will type code expressions. The interpreter awaits our instructions step by step. This is often how we want to work when quick testing small portions of code, or when doing small calculations. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "While some Python programmers execute all of their Python code in this way, those doing data analysis or scientific computing make use of IPython, an enhanced Python interpreter, or Jupyter notebooks, web-based code notebooks originally created within the IPython project.\n",
    "\n",
    "## IPython\n",

    "![ipython.jpg](images/ipython.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The default IPython prompt adopts the numbered `In [1]:` style compared with the standard `>>> prompt.\n",
    "You can execute arbitrary Python statements by typing them in and pressing Return (or Enter). When you type just a variable into IPython, it renders a string representa‚Äê tion of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Jupyter notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebook is an HTML-based notebook environment for Python, similar to Mathematica or Matlab. It is based on the IPython shell, but provides a cell-based environment with great interactivity, where calculations can be organized and documented in a structured way.  \n",
