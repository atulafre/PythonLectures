    "# What is Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "[Python](www.python.org) is a modern, general-purpose, object-oriented, high-level programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "General characteristics of Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *clean and simple language*: easy to read code, easy to learn syntax, maintainability scales well with size of projects.\n",
    "* *expressive language*: fewer lines of code, fewer bugs, easier to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Technical details:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *dynamically typed*: no need to define the type of variables, function arguments or return types.\n",
    "* *automatic memory management*: no need to explicitly allocate and deallocate memory for variables and data arrays.\n",
    "* *interpreted*: no need to compile the code, the Python interpreter reads and executes the python code directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ease of programming, minimizing the time required to develop, debug and maintain the code.\n",
    "* Well designed language that encourage many good programming practices:\n",
    "  * Modular and object-oriented programming, good system for packaging and re-use of code.\n",
    "  * Documentation tightly integrated with the code.\n",
    "* A large standard library, and a large collection of add-on packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Since Python is an interpreted and dynamically typed programming language, the execution of python code can be slow compared to compiled statically typed programming languages, such as C/C++.\n",
    "* Somewhat decentralized, with different environment, packages and documentation spread out at different places.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is not only a programming language, but often also refers to the standard implementation of the interpreter (technically referred to as [CPython](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPython)) that actually runs the Python code on a computer."

    "# Interpretation versus compilation\n",
    "\n",
    "The are two different types of computer languages: **compiled** languages and **interpreted** languages. Roughly speaking, programs written with *compiled languages* are first translated (**compiled**) into a form (**binary code**) that the computer hardware understands, and then run. Porgrams written with an **interpreted language** are translated step bt step by a special computer program, called **interpreter**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The *interpreter* is a computer program that directly executes instructions written in a interpreted language, without requiring them previously to have been compiled into a binary code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typical compliled languages are C++ and Go. Python is an interpreted language, like Perl and Javascript.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create and execute a compiled program, a programmer must:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create the program source code.\n",
    "* Parse or analyses all of the language statements in the source code for correctness. If incorrect, throws an error.\n",
    "* Convert source code to machine code.\n",
    "* Link different code files into a runnable program.\n",
    "* Run the program.\n",

    "# Python environments\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different *environments* through which the Python *interpreter* can be used. Each environment has different advantages and is suitable for different workflows. One strength of Python is that it is versatile and can be used in complementary ways, but it can be confusing for beginners so we will start with a brief survey of python environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python interpreter\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard way to use the Python programming language is to use the Python interpreter to run Python code. The Python interpreter is a program that reads and execute the python code in files passed to it as arguments. At the command prompt, the command `python` is used to invoke the Python interpreter.\n",
    "For example, to run a file `my-program.py` that contains Python code from the command prompt, use:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "$ python my-program.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> The **$** symbol in the command line instructions denotes the prompt, so it must not be copy-pasted.\n",

    "\n",
    "![python-shell.jpg](images/python-shell.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The `>>>` symbols represent the *prompt* where you will type code expressions. The interpreter awaits our instructions step by step. This is often how we want to work when quick testing small portions of code, or when doing small calculations. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "While some Python programmers execute all of their Python code in this way, those doing data analysis or scientific computing make use of IPython, an enhanced Python interpreter, or Jupyter notebooks, web-based code notebooks originally created within the IPython project.\n",

    "\n",
    "The default IPython prompt adopts the numbered `In [1]:` style compared with the standard `>>> prompt.\n",
    "You can execute arbitrary Python statements by typing them in and pressing Return (or Enter). When you type just a variable into IPython, it renders a string representa‚Äê tion of the object.\n",

    "In our example, we would just need to create a separate virtual environment for both *ProjectA* and *ProjectB*,  Each environment, in turn, would be able to depend on whatever version of *ProjectC* they choose, independent of the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Practically, virtual environments are just directories containing a few scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating a virtual environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Start by making a new directory to work with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ mkdir python-virtual-environments\n",
    "$ cd python-virtual-environments\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a new virtual environment inside the directory:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ python3 -m venv env\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**By default, this will not include any of your existing site packages.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, this command creates a directory called `env`, which contains a directory structure similar to this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "env\n",
    "‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bin\n",
    "‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Activate.ps1\n",
    "‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ activate\n",
    "‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ activate.csh\n",
    "‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ activate.fish\n",
    "‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ easy_install\n",
    "‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ easy_install-3.8\n",
    "‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pip\n",

    "‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ site-packages\n",
    "...\n",
    "‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pyvenv.cfg\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where the folders contain:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `bin`: the files that interact with the virtual environment\n",
    "* `include`: the C headers that compile the Python packages\n",
    "* `lib`: a copy of the Python version along with a site-packages folder where each dependency is installed\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `bin`folder there are copies of, or symlinks to, a few different Python tools as well as to the Python executables themselves. These files are used to ensure that all Python code and commands are executed within the context of the current environment, which is how the isolation from the global environment is achieved. The *activate scripts* are used to set up your shell to use the environment‚Äôs Python executable and its site-packages by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using a virtual environment\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to use this environment‚Äôs packages/resources in isolation, you need to ‚Äúactivate‚Äù it. To do this, just run the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ source env/bin/activate\n",
    "(env) $\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how your prompt is now prefixed with the name of your environment (`env`, in our case). This is the indicator that `env` is currently active, which means the `python` executable will only use this environment‚Äôs packages and settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "To show the package isolation in action, we can use the `bcrypt` module as an example. Let‚Äôs say we have `bcrypt` installed system-wide but not in our virtual environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we test this, we need to go back to the ‚Äúsystem‚Äù context by executing deactivate:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "(env) $ deactivate\n",
    "$\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now your shell session is back to normal, and the `python` command refers to the global Python install. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, install `bcrypt` and use it to hash a password:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ pip -q install bcrypt\n",
    "$ python -c \"import bcrypt; print(bcrypt.hashpw('password'.encode('utf-8'), bcrypt.gensalt()))\"\n",
    "b'$2b$12$G5bwXFWYvvu3lSchR6taFeaBHehPRbQH4OFcIhCTZ1weEngWl5tz6'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here‚Äôs what happens if we try the same command when the virtual environment is activated:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ source env/bin/activate\n",
    "(env) $ python -c \"import bcrypt; print(bcrypt.hashpw('password'.encode('utf-8'), bcrypt.gensalt()))\"\n",
    "Traceback (most recent call last):\n",
    "  File \"<string>\", line 1, in <module>\n",
    "ImportError: No module named 'bcrypt'\n",
    "```\n",
    "As you can see, the behavior of the `python -c \"import bcrypt...\"` command changes after the `source env/bin/activate` call.\n",
    "\n",
    "In one instance, we have `bcrypt` available to us, and in the next we don‚Äôt. This is the kind of separation we‚Äôre looking to achieve with virtual environments, which is now easily achieved.\n",
