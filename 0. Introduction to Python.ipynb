    "# What is Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "[Python](www.python.org) is a modern, general-purpose, object-oriented, high-level programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "General characteristics of Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *clean and simple language*: easy to read code, easy to learn syntax, maintainability scales well with size of projects.\n",
    "* *expressive language*: fewer lines of code, fewer bugs, easier to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Technical details:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *dynamically typed*: no need to define the type of variables, function arguments or return types.\n",
    "* *automatic memory management*: no need to explicitly allocate and deallocate memory for variables and data arrays.\n",
    "* *interpreted*: no need to compile the code, the Python interpreter reads and executes the python code directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ease of programming, minimizing the time required to develop, debug and maintain the code.\n",
    "* Well designed language that encourage many good programming practices:\n",
    "  * Modular and object-oriented programming, good system for packaging and re-use of code.\n",
    "  * Documentation tightly integrated with the code.\n",
    "* A large standard library, and a large collection of add-on packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Since Python is an interpreted and dynamically typed programming language, the execution of python code can be slow compared to compiled statically typed programming languages, such as C/C++.\n",
    "* Somewhat decentralized, with different environment, packages and documentation spread out at different places.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is not only a programming language, but often also refers to the standard implementation of the interpreter (technically referred to as [CPython](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPython)) that actually runs the Python code on a computer."

    "# Python environments\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different environments through which the Python interpreter can be used. Each environment has different advantages and is suitable for different workflows. One strength of python is that it is versatile and can be used in complementary ways, but it can be confusing for beginners so we will start with a brief survey of python environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python interpreter\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard way to use the Python programming language is to use the Python interpreter to run Python code. The python interpreter is a program that reads and execute the python code in files passed to it as arguments. At the command prompt, the command `python` is used to invoke the Python interpreter.\n",
    "For example, to run a file `my-program.py` that contains Python code from the command prompt, use:\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "$ python my-program.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python shell\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also start the interpreter by simply typing `python` at the command line, and interactively type Python code into the interpreter (press `Ctrl+D` to exit):\n",
    "\n",
    "![python-shell.jpg](images/python-shell.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is often how we want to work when quick testing small portions of code, or when doing small calculations. But the standard python interpreter is not very convenient for this kind of work, due to a number of limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### IPython shell\n",
    "\n",
    "IPython is an interactive shell that addresses the limitation of the standard Python interpreter. It provides an interactive prompt to the Python interpreter with a greatly improved user-friendliness. Type `ipython` at the command line to start IPython (press `Ctrl+D` to exit):\n",
    "\n",
    "![ipython.jpg](images/ipython.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Jupyter notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebook is an HTML-based notebook environment for Python, similar to Mathematica or Matlab. It is based on the IPython shell, but provides a cell-based environment with great interactivity, where calculations can be organized and documented in a structured way.  \n",
    "Although using a web browser as graphical interface, Jupyter notebooks are usually run locally, from the same computer that runs the browser. To start a new Jupyter notebook session, run the following command:\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "$ jupyter notebook\n",
    "```\n",
    "from a directory where you want the notebooks to be stored. This will open a new browser window (or a new tab in an existing window) with an index page where existing notebooks are shown and from which new notebooks can be created."
